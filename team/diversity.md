# Diversity

Diversity is foundational to our company, MusiCore, as a product should capture all aspects of a diverse landscape and we must cater to a diverse customer base. Since music can be played in so many different types of events and businesses, diversity in a team can give us insight on these different types. As well, SOCAN and Dataclef, our clients, are also made up of many different types of people, and MusiCore should reflect this in our team as well. In this document, we will explain our team background and expertise strengths. Then we will go into where our team is lacking in expertise and how we will look to SMEs to fill those gaps. We will also explain where we lack in diversity and how it may impact us as a company.

At MusiCore, we will always strive to mitigate our diversity gaps in order to deliver the best experience possible for our customers.

Team Background
---

Our team has a varied background. Anusha, Frank, Haris and Jamal's ethnical background is from South Asia however they grew up in Canada. Beatrice is from Singapore and speaks Chinese. This can give us greater insights in certain Asian and Canadian markets as music is played by people of all backgrounds. We also have a roughly even gender ratio (between men and women) such that Anusha and Beatrice identify as women while Frank, Haris and Jamal identify as men. Given that this is a tech start-up project and only 13% of Canadian tech companies have founders who are women (PwC Canada, 2017), our team diversifies from that and this can help when addressing issues for different genders.

## Strengths

Starting with Anusha, she is a Computer Science specialist with a strong technical background in working in the software industry. Anusha has worked on web and mobile applications before, which can help when creating the technical component of our product. Additionally, she also has experience in designing functional UI/UX experiences for many users such that she can design an effective user interface for the application. She also has good problem-solving skills and is ready to tackle any issue with the project.

Beatrice is in Computer Science and hails from the National University of Singapore. With this, she brings a unique and more global perspective to our team. She also has a strong programming background with expertise in Python and SQL languages, which can help with the backend and data component of our product. She is currently working in a fintech startup in Toronto where she has acquired knowledge of the startup industry which will aid the business side of the project. She is also a team player and effectively work well with everyone.

Frank is another Computer Science student and has a variety of experience from working both as a full-stack and back-end developer in the software industry. He has expertise in working with and designing APIs which can be helpful when doing third-party integration in our software. He has also worked in the start-up industry in Toronto before and has knowledge of how the industry works which again will give us more help in the business side. He also has great time management skills and helps in making sure our milestones get delivered on time. 

Haris is also in Computer Science and has heavily been involved in the start-up industry. He worked at a VC-funded startup in the United States and where he learned about different aspects of building a start-up, which brings a business experience from another country. In addition, he has experience with React and Tensorflow which would help both the front-end and machine learning aspects of the project. Haris is also a good public speaker which can help when we want to deliver pitches for our product.

Lastly, Jamal is a Computer Science student, and a Finance major as well. Through his dual experience, he has developed software skills where he has worked on many web applications, and has a strong understanding of business concepts. He has also participated in several hackathons before which help him in delivering strong pitches as well. 

# Team Weaknesses

First, we don't have much variance in other majors aside from Computer Science except Jamal who is also Finance. For this project, we are especially missing people with solely business or legal areas of expertise. Also, the theme of the project does lie within the music copyright industry, and we don't have any expertise in that area either. A successful startup should have people from a variety of areas of expertise so people can fill roles from business to software that is required for a company.

As well, in terms of technical experience, while we all have a strong background in Computer Science, both Anusha and Jamal have limited machine learning experience. They have both taken machine learning courses before, however they don't have practical experience with it, and machine learning could be helpful in case we want to apply NLP into our application. They also don't have much experience in the designing robust local developer environments, which will be required in order to make sure developers can run the app smoothly.

### Subject Matter Experts
To help us address our expertise gaps, on the business side, we have Mario Grech as our Subject matter expert (SME) who has dealt with many startups before and is teaching CSC454. We can even set up meetings with him where he can help give us knowledge about how to segment our market and address our customers. If we need to clarify questions about music copyright, we have Catherine Moore, SOCAN and Dataclef who can provide support to us.

We'll need to find an SME who can help us in legal software matters, this may be someone in the software industry who works with many software companies and their technologies. This could be helpful in addressing our privacy concerns too, with regards to data collection and analytics in our application.

On the technical side, Vinith Suriyakumar is currently a graduate student with Machine Learning experience who can help us in that area. Julian Nadeau who is teaching CSC491 and is working at Github has experience in local developer environments and can help us if we have trouble with the developer scripts and Docker.

## Diversity and its Impact
Even though we do have some racial and ethnical diversity, we donâ€™t cover many geographical areas. Namely, all of our members are primarily of South- or Southeast-Asian descent. Also, all of our members grew up in Canada, with the exception of Beatrice - who grew up in Singapore. 

Both of these factors may affect our company's global vision. We're lacking perspective and knowledge of major target markets such as Europe, South America, Africa, and others. As our product targets events for licence lead generation for events, we may not have a strong understanding of the cultural aspects of various events. We can talk to and interview people with more diverse national and racial backgrounds could help broaden our view of global events and understand the global market better.

Another area in which we lack diversity is in the lack of people with disabilities on our team. As none of our team members are disabled in any way, our product vision may lack a focus on accessibility. There are certain things that we may not take into account when designing/developing our product UI/UX, or other functionality within our app. In order to help us mitigate this, we can conduct testing with people with disabilities who can use our application to inform us of any issues they experience with it. For example, we can conduct testing with people who experience colour blindness or motor skills impairment, to ensure that they find our application easy to use and navigate.

We face a lack of age diversity as well, since our team is made up entirely of early 20-year-olds. This potentially limits our knowledge about events that target other age groups. To get through our bias, we would need to talk to event organizers of different age groups who can give us a better insight.  For example, we could talk to schools that organize events for young children to understand their music licencing needs.
